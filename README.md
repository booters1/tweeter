# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone designed to help users practice and improve their web development skills. This project provides a hands-on opportunity to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX for the front-end, and Node.js with Express for the back-end.

By building a Twitter-like application, experience was gained in front-end and back-end development, including client-server communication, dynamic content rendering, and user interface design.

Project Features: Tweeter allows users to compose and post tweets, and view tweets. Users can also see timestamps for each tweet.
